-- $callbacksProblem
--   We have a huge problem for callbacks: we *have* to call
--   'freeHaskellFunPtr' to every Haskell function that was
--   passed via FFI to C code after we don't need them.
--   However, the 'ForeignPtr' that the 'Space' has can
--   portably have finalizers only in the FFI, never in the
--   Haskell land, so we can't run the Haskell function
--   'freeHaskellFunPtr' from a 'ForeignPtr' finalizer.
--
--   There are two options:
--
--     1. Use "Foreign.Concurrent" to add a Haskell finalizer.
--        Under GHC this is great and adds no overhead (maybe there's
--        even less overhead than calling a C function).
--        However "Foreign.Concurrent" is not portable and
--        works only under GHC.
--
--     2. Require that users of the library (you) call
--        a finalizer function when they plan to stop using
--        the space. This adds some burden to the programmer
--        and somehow defeats the purpose of the GC, however
--        it works everywhere.
--
--   As this is a library that intends to be as portable as
--   possible (like Chipmunk itself), of course I chose
--   to follow the second path. This means that your code will
--   run unchanged on every Haskell environment supporting
--   FFI with C99, but also that you have to take care to
--   avoid memory leaks. You've been warned! :)
--
--   Note: callbacks are implemented in
--   "Physics.Hipmunk.Callbacks" module.

-- $resizing
--   @'resizeStaticHash' sp dim count@ resizes the static
--   hash of space @sp@ to have hash cells of size @dim@
--   and suggested minimum number of cells @count@.
--   @'resizeActiveHash' sp dim count@ works the same way
--   but modifying the active hash of the space.
--
--   Chipmunk's performance is highly sensitive to both
--   parameters, which should be hand-tuned to maximize
--   performance. It is in general recommended to set @dim@ as
--   the average object size and @count@ around 10 times the
--   number of objects in the hash. Usually bigger numbers are
--   better to @count@, but only to a certain point. By default
--   dim is @100.0@ and count is @1000@.
--
--   Note that in the case of the static hash you may try
--   larger numbers as the static hash is only rehashed
--   when requested by 'rehashStatic', however that will
--   use more memory.

--
--   * Shares at least one layer with @l@.
--

--   and only once, for each of the shapes described above
--   (and never for those who aren't).
